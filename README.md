**NAME**: ADMINISTRATIVE CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

VERSION 1.0.1

### DESCRIPTION: 

Content Based management system is primarly a dynamic blogging site where users can post their feed and give comments on those. There are many categories un which the users can posts which in our project includes Bootstrap, Javascript, PHP, etc. The admin can register for the users who are willing to post on the system, monitor the posts and the commments which the users give. 

### BASIC OPERATIONS IN SETTING UP THE WEBSITE: 

We have first developed the front end of the website using the frameworks. Usage of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap along with jQuery has been done in this process.
We then created the database using the phpMyAdmin.
To test the applcication we seeded some raw data in.
PHP Files were created to access and modify the contents in the database synchronous with the respective front end operations. Crude operations were performed on the data for the complete implemetation of the testing phase which comprises of every functionality in the system. 


### PROCEDURE FOR ACCESSING THE CONTENTS: 

The access for a user to post, comment in the blog can only be given by the admin. The admin first logs on into the site where the admin panel getss displayed. 
The admin has the access to register a user and perform the add, edit and delete comments of the fellow users along with monitoring the user activity.
The user once granted the access to the website can view other users's posts and comments and can post his own stuff into it.
The admin if not satsified with the users's comments which could be due to the language used, can disapprove the same which results in disappearence from the comments section. 
The admin also has a graph displaying the total no of users, posts posted by those users.
